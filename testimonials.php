                <p class="message">My friend got me a gift of Butta Cakes and now I‚Äôm torn. Torn because I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs my best friend or my worst enemy to have introduced me to the dessert version of crack. 
                        These little bites of deliciousness are full of flavor and are a perfect combination of textures. You think, ‚ÄúOh, what a delight! All I need is one of these and it will be a nice treat.‚Äù The next thing you know you are 12 Butta Cakes in and you really don‚Äôt feel the least bit guilty because, taste buds be praised, you are just too full of happy dessert goodness to care about insignificant things like calorie consumption and waist lines! After all, life is too short and the Butta Cakes be plentiful!
                        I think my favorite is the cinnamon, coming in a close first (the only place is first when it comes to Butta Cakes, just take note) is the red velvet, and another close first is all of the rest. 
                        You must try these!! Your life is incomplete and meaningless without Butta Cakes. Trust me, I know.</p>

                <p class="message">I am NOT a sweets person, allow me to start with that...I could curse the parent at Cochise that had me try the peanut butter chocolate Butta Cake, as I ended up leaving with a 16 sampler set. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!! I bought them with the intention of SHARING them with some of my event industry friends like Stylish Events by Lisa, Nicole Arend Weddings and Events, but, alas, I couldn't part with them.

                        These are PERFECT for parties, entertaining, and may I even venture to say WEDDINGS, as most people just want a BITE, and these are just the right size to satisfy, have the bite of good luck, as well as get addicted.
                        
                        Thanks for being at the Cochise Art Festival! Hope to see you at the Decades Dance as well! üôÇ</p>

                <p class="message">HOLY SHEET, these are like crack! A friend gave us all a five box variety for V-Day. I just had a bite of the birthday cake looking one with sprinkles (perhaps it's just the vanilla as I don't see birthday cake on your website). OMGosh AMAZING!!! The bottom is a little gooey heaven, but then the sides are a wee bit of crunchy heaven and OMGosh it's AMAAAAAZING. I tried two more that were descent (I'm very picky, anyone else would love), but then the Red Velvet one, HOLY COW, HEAVEN!!!! The chocolate chip cookie dough, pretty amazing!!! Why on earth are they so dainty small????? I know this is Snottsdale, but the rest of the population need more, let us be realistic here. I need more, we're talking cupcake size please. I'll deal with how sick I get, you don't worry about that. WOW, you have a good thing here! THANK YOU, my thighs dislike you very much, but still...make cupcake size please and thank you.</p>

Took the "Pick Your Own" dozen to a small dinner party and everyone loved the mini cakes! They were a hit! Will be ordering from them again.</p>

                <p class="message">I have ordered these mini cakes twice now, and they have not disappointed!  They are a bite of heaven, you will not have any left. I did the assortment for the adults at my son's birthday party. There were none left, and then decided to get more for a friend's birthday party. I think they go so quickly because they are a good alternative for something sweet without having a full piece if cake. Haha, even though parents were having multiple cakes :)</p>

                <p class="message">We ordered a few dozen bite-sized cakes for a party dessert, and they were a huge hit.  They were delivered right on time, were absolutely delicious, and we were lucky enough to have a few (very few, though) left over to enjoy ourselves when everyone went home.  It's hard to say which one was our favorite, but the red velvet and peanut butter were amazing.  We can't wait to try a larger cake.</p>
